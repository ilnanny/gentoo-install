* All different logging daemons have completely different default configs,
logrotate do not rotate everything by default, logcheck either does not check
all or tries to check non-existing logfiles (in case of syslog-ng default
config), which causes errors. Also see
<http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/security/security-handbook.xml?part=1&chap=3>.

* Possibility to configure portage overlays and install automatically
additional packages from them after layman is emerged and configured.
